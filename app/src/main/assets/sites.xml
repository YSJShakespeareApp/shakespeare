<history> Richard III was the last Plantagenet King of England, however he only ruled for a short period of time (1483 – 1485). Before becoming King Richard had already had strong connections to the north, however during his reign Richard concluded a truce that he had with Scotland in order to reduce his commitment to the North. Throughout his reign he faced many challenges to his place on the throne and resentment towards him began to grow and grow. Richard died in 1485 while fighting to keep his throne at the Battle of Bosworth. </history>
<shakespeare>Shakespeare’s physical representation of Richard contrasts what we would expect of a protagonist, especially one depicting the reign of a former King of England. The Richard that Shakespeare presents his audience with is that of a “Deform’d, unfinish’d” man, a man who is physically challenged and straight away portrays a sense of evil about him.</shakespeare>
